# Celestial Navigation

In this document I'll try to break down everything I learned about the practice of navigating using celestial bodies.

## The General Idea

In modern celestial navigation, we will be using a tool to measure how high in the sky a couple of celestial bodies are, more specifically, we'll measure their altitude angles.
Generally we use a tool called **nautical sextant**, which allows you to measure the angle between two points in the distance.
How high the celestial body appears in our sky determines how far we are from the **geographical position** (GP) of that celestial body, which is simply the point on earth directly below it.
To figure out the GP of a celestial body we'll be using a type of book called **the nautical almanac**.
Because the GP of the celestial bodies are constantly changing we also need to record the precise time at which the altitude of the celestial body was.
